* Spring 2022 - Lab 07

* Last name: Fan

* First name: Henry

* GitHub username: henryfan03

* Notes: The original bad code file is the one thats given, my program will take it, modify it, and output it into a new file named good-code.cpp, it will also show this in the main function when called as well. I used doctest and my makefile has a target for it, note that there are only two cases, it is to test the two functions that are talked about in the LAB 7 assignment page (that being removing the indents and character counting)
  
* General instructions:
- Fill in your name and GitHub username on top.
- Use the Notes section to add any notes to the instructor.
- The main lab description can be found here:

* Specific instructions for lab 07

For this lab, it is up to you how to structure and write everything
and as such this repo starts mostly empty. It includes ~doctest.h~ in
case you plan to use it for testing but for this lab ~doctest.h~ based
tests are not required.

Even though you will decide on what and how to implement your
solution, the lab *must* include the following:

1. There *must* be a ~Makefile~ that has at least the following
   targets: 
   1. ~main~ to build an executable named ~main~.
   2. ~clean~ which will get rid of ~.o~ files.
   3. If you are using ~doctest.h~ you should have a ~tests~ target but
      if you do not, you don't need this target.
2. You *must* include at least one poorly formatted C++ file to test
   your program on in the repository.
3. *Do not* add/commit/push the "fixed" file that your program
   produces.
4. If I need to know anything, please write it in the *Notes:* section
   above.
